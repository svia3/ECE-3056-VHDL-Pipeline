# ECE3056 - MIPS Pipeline 

This is an .vhdl implementation of a MIPS pipeline that utilizes dataforwarding and branching written during my Spring 2019 semester at the Georgia Institute of Technology. It utilizes the common 5-stage, “RISC” load‐store architecture. This program was written for an advanced junior level class on computer architecture and modeling, entitled: "Architecture, Systems, Concurrency and Energy in Computation."
